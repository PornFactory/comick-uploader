## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Details

### 1. How to Get Your Cookies

This file is essential for authenticating your requests.

1.  **Install a Cookie Editor Extension**: Get **Cookie-Editor** for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cookie-editor/hlkenndednhfkekhgcdicdfddnkalmdm) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-editor/).
2.  **Log in to Comick.io**.
3.  **Export Cookies**:
    - Click the Cookie-Editor extension icon.
    - Click the **Export** button.
    - Choose **JSON** as the export format and **Copy to Clipboard**.
4.  **Paste into `cookies.txt`**: Open your `cookies.txt` file and replace its contents with the JSON you copied.

> **Important**: If you encounter `403 Forbidden` errors, your Cloudflare cookie has likely expired. **Re-export your cookies** to fix this.

### 2. How to Organize Chapter Folders

The script expects a specific folder structure.

-   Each sub-folder **must be named with the chapter number** (e.g., `21`, `22.5`).
-   Inside each folder, image files should be numbered in reading order (e.g., `01.png`, `02.png`).

**Example Structure:**
```
/comick-uploader/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ chapters/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 21/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01.png
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 02.png
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 03.png
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 21.5/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 001.webp
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 002.webp
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 003.webp
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 22/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01.png
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 02.png
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 23/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01.webp
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 02.webp
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 03.webp
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...

```

## üöÄ How to Use

After launching the program (`uploader.exe` or `python uploader.py`), follow the interactive prompts:

-   **Manga URL**: Paste the URL of the manga series on Comick.io.
-   **Chapters Folder Path**: Press **Enter** to use the default `./chapters` folder, or provide a custom path.
-   **Volume Number**: Enter a volume number for the batch or press **Enter** to skip.
-   **Group Selection**: Choose `o` for Official, `s` to Search, or `u` for Unknown.
-   **Language Selection**: Enter the language code or press **Enter** for English (`en`).
-   **Release Timer**: Set a release delay from 0 to 4 hours. Press **Enter** for an instant release.
-   **Parallel Uploads**: Choose how many chapters to upload at once (1-10) or press **Enter** for the default (3).
    > **Disclaimer**: Setting this value too high may cause the server to reject requests (`500 Server Error`). The default of 3 is recommended for stability.
-   **Confirmation**: Review the summary and press `y` to begin.

## üîç Troubleshooting

-   **`Failed: 500 Server Error`**: The server rejected the request, likely due to a high volume of concurrent uploads. **Solution**: Rerun the script with a lower number of parallel uploads (e.g., the default of 3).
-   **`403 Forbidden` Error**: Your Cloudflare cookie is invalid. **Solution**: Refresh comick.io in your browser and re-export your cookies into `cookies.txt`.
-   **`ModuleNotFoundError`** (Python users): Dependencies are not installed. **Solution**: Activate your virtual environment and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
-   **`FileNotFoundError: 'cookies.txt'`**: **Solution**: Ensure you have created and correctly named `cookies.txt` in the same directory as the executable/script.
-   **UI Looks Garbled**: If the progress bar looks messy (e.g., you see `[K` or `[3A`), your terminal does not support ANSI escape codes. **Solution**: Use a modern terminal like Windows Terminal, PowerShell, or most terminals on macOS and Linux.
